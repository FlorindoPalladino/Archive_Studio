These letterbooks contain a series of letters transcribed sequentially by a scribe, and letters may span multiple pages.

Your task is to insert a letter break marker ("*****") on a new line immediately before the beginning of each new letter. To do this accurately, follow these guidelines:

1. Identify a New Letter Opening:

Header Indicators: Look for a distinct block that includes one or more of the following: a salutation, a date, a place name, an address, an addressee's name, or a greeting (e.g., "New York, 23d Jany 1789", "Messrs Phynn and Ellis", "Dear Sir,"). This block is usually formatted separately from the narrative text.

Formatting Cues: Notice any clear changes in formatting such as text being offset, right-justified, or indented compared to the preceding narrative. Such changes often indicate the start of a letter.

2. Contextual Analysis:

End of Previous Letter: Determine where the previous letter ends. Typical end-of-letter elements include a signature, a closing salutation, or a block containing a place name or address.

Paragraph Continuity: If one paragraph directly follows another without a new header (i.e., no new name, date, address, or distinct formatting), treat it as a continuation of the same letterâ€”even if the subject matter shifts.

3. Avoiding False Breaks:

No Break on Internal Paragraphs: Do not insert a letter break marker between paragraphs that are part of the same letter. A mere change in subject matter or a simple formatting variation that does not involve a standalone header should not trigger a new letter marker.

Uncertainty: When it is unclear whether a new letter is starting, rely on the absence of header elements and distinct formatting. In such cases, do not insert a break marker.

In your response, begin by providing a brief explanation of how the above clues were evaluated. Then on a new line write "Transcription:" followed by the present transcription of the text, inserting the letter break marker ("*****") on a new line immediately before any confirmed new letter.

Your objective is to ensure that break markers are inserted only when a new letter truly begins, avoiding incorrect breaks between paragraphs within the same letter.''',

Your task is to insert an entry break marker ("*****") on a new line immediately before the beginning of each new diary entry (including the first entry on the page if it begins on this page). To do this accurately, follow these guidelines:

1. Identify a New Diary Entry Opening:

Date Indicators: Look for temporal markers that typically begin a new entry (e.g., "January 23, 1789", "Monday 4th", "Saturday 4th", etc). These date markers will always be found at the beginning of a paragraph.

Formatting Cues: Notice any clear changes in formatting such as marginal notations, paragraphing, indentation, line breaks, or that consistently indicate a new entry in this diary.

2. Contextual Analysis:

Chunk Boundaries: Be aware that the text you're analyzing might begin in the middle of an entry. If the text begins without a clear date marker but seems to continue from a previous page, it likely belongs to an entry that started on the previous page.

3. Avoiding False Breaks:

No Break on Topic Changes: Do not insert an entry break marker when the diarist merely changes topics within the same day's entry.

No Break on New Paragraphs that Do Not Begin With Some Sort of Date Indicator: Do not insert an entry break marker when the diarist merely starts a new paragraph that does not begin a new entry, as identified by the Date Indicators above.

Handling Uncertainty: If you cannot determine with reasonable confidence whether text represents a new entry, err on the side of continuity and do not insert a break marker.

In your response, begin by providing a brief explanation of how you identified entry breaks. Then on a new line write "Processed Diary Text:" followed by the exact text of the provided page with entry break markers ("*****") inserted on a new line immediately before each new diary entry.
